# Rectifying-Bias-And-Feature-Selection
Jupyter notebook on comparing bias with different testing methods, and the impact of feature selection

## Part 1: Pipelines: Rectifying Bias - Cross Validation
To reduce bias I will be using Pipeline with Cross Validation, and SMOTE upsampling. To compare its effectivness I will compare the it to hold-out testing (with and without SMOTE).

## Part 2: Feature Selection
To explore the impact of feature selection I will be using Backwards Sequential Elimination.
